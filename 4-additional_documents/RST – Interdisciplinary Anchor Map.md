This document outlines the major academic and conceptual domains that resonate with the RST framework.  
It does **not** claim expertise in these fields.  
It shows **where RST structurally touches established discourses**, allowing interested readers to explore connections on their own.

---

## 1. Second-Order Cybernetics & Systems Theory  
**RST connections:**  
- P0 governance layer  
- Drift-control and marker system  
- Recursive self-observation  
- Semantic Marker Network as feedback architecture  

**Conceptual relevance:**  
Self-referential systems, stabilizing loops, observer-in-the-system logic.

---

## 2. Constructivism & Epistemology  
**RST connections:**  
- “Knowledge arises through movement”  
- Emergent meaning through interaction  
- Dialog-as-process as epistemic engine  

**Conceptual relevance:**  
Meaning as construction rather than static representation.

---

## 3. Enactivism & Embodied Cognition  
**RST connections:**  
- Movement-based cognition  
- Dynamical emergence  
- Appendix-Lab 1 – Knowledge Through Movement

**Conceptual relevance:**  
Cognition as lived activity; understanding arises in doing.

---

## 4. Psychology: Metacognition & Self-Regulation  
**RST connections:**  
- Marker hierarchy (M-1 to M-4)  
- Energetics and drift as attention regulation  
- RST as a meta-cognitive stabilizer  

**Conceptual relevance:**  
Self-monitoring, control processes, cognitive feedback.

---

## 5. Human–AI Interaction & Co-Creativity  
**RST connections:**  
- Co-creative interaction architecture  
- P0 conventions for role clarity  
- SMN/Marker structures as dialog governance  

**Conceptual relevance:**  
Structured collaboration between humans and models.

---

## 6. AI Governance & Alignment (local interaction)  
**RST connections:**  
- Alignment through interaction, not training  
- Drift detection  
- Reflexive safety patterns  

**Conceptual relevance:**  
Soft alignment via structure and dialog protocols.

---

## 7. Sociology & Science and Technology Studies  
**RST connections:**  
- RST as socio-technical emergence  
- “Accident & Synthesis” as documented process  
- Repo transparency as “science in action”  

**Conceptual relevance:**  
How systems and knowledge practices form in real time.

---

## 8. Cognitive Engineering & Interface Logic  
**RST connections:**  
- SMN as externalized cognition  
- Structure as self-regulation  
- System-building as thinking  

**Conceptual relevance:**  
Designing cognitive environments to stabilize thought.

### Purpose of this document  
To give readers a **map** of ideas they may explore to understand RST in broader context.  
It is intentionally non-authoritative and does not imply disciplinary mastery.
