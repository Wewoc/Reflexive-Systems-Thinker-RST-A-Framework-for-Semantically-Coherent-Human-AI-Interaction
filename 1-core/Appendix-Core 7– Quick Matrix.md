LAYER: CORE_AUX
DOC_TYPE: REFERENCE
NOTE: Quick reference for functional modes (matrix), optional but recommended.

| Mode | Typical Input (Short) | Output | Primary Effect (RST) | Marker | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A Decision | “X or Y?” | Checklist + Recommendation | Switches to **decision mode** | Thresholds, DoD, minimal variant | Compression under uncertainty |
| B Tech/Standard | Parameter/Norm | Rule sheet + Table | Standards **context-bound** | Reference → Action | False sense of certainty |
| C Planning | Goal + Constraints | Plan (Steps/MS) | **Operationalization** | Risks, checkpoints | Less exploration |
| D Risk | “What goes wrong?” | Risk Heatmap | Chains & **Triggers** | Early markers, residual risk | Conservative bias |
| E Research | 5–10 sources | Evidence Synopsis | Context harmonization | Evidence levels, gaps | Nuance loss |
| F Brainstorm | Open idea | Option Funnel | Divergence → Convergence | Cluster, criteria | Creativity flattened |
| G Editing | Draft text | Structural Edit | **Drift control** | Tone/Coherence | “Too factual” |
| H Meeting | Conversation log | Decision Protocol | Decisions/To-Dos | Owner, Deadline | Soft signals missing |
| I Code Review | Diff/Requirement | Review Checklist | Error/Rule Alignment | Tests, DoD | Rule overweight |
| J UX/JTBD | Use Case/Jobs | JTBD Board | Outcome Focus | Jobs/Pains/Gains | Microcopy missing |
| K Teaching | “How does…?” | Guide + Check | Learning Path + Test Questions | Mini examples | Warmth ↓ |
| L Trade-off | Positions/Constraints | Trade-off Matrix | Criteria/Trade-offs | Weighting | Empathy ↓ |
| M E-Mail | Bullet Points + Goal | One-pager + CTA | Purpose-bound Writing | Goal, CTA, Audience fit | Tone strict |
| N Exec Summary | Long text | One-pager | Signal > Noise | Key points, Implications | Details lost |
| O Localization | Text + Glossary | Terminology Version | **Coherent Terminology** | Glossary Binding | Nuance ↓ |
| P Extraction | Contract/Protocol | Field Table | Field/Criteria Definition | Pos/Neg Examples, Confidence | Edge cases overlooked |
| Q SQL/Excel | Question + Schema | Query/Formula + Tests | **Query with Validation Marker** | Test Case, Expected Values | Schema assumptions |
| R Regex | Rules/Examples | Regex + Tests | Example-first + Negative Tests | FP Killer | Over-fit possible |
| S DevOps | Goal/Environment | Commands + Guardrails | **Safe Defaults** | Dry-run, Rollback | Too conservative |
| T API/Contract | Endpoint Sketch | API Spec + Tests | **Acceptance Criteria** | Status Codes, Errors | Effort ↑ |
| U Tests | User Story | Test Matrix | Happy/Edge/Fail | Oracle/Claims | Maintenance effort |
| V Release Notes | Commits | Structured Notes | User-value Focus | Impact, Breaking | Marketing warmth ↓ |
| W CV Match | JD + CV | Fit Matrix + Gap Plan | Criteria Matching | Must/Can, Evidence | Tone impersonal |
| X Support | FAQ/Ticket | Macro Set + Trigger | Consistency & Escalation | When/Then, Escalate | Case nuance loss |
| Y SEO Briefing | Keyword Goal | Briefing + Outline | Goal-oriented Structure | Intent, H2/H3, KPI | Language ↓ |
| Z A/B Design | Hypothesis | Experiment Plan | Metrics/Abort Criteria | MDE, Power | Rigid for exploratory work |
