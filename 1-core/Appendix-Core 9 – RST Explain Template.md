# Appendix-Core 9 – RST Explain Template - Safe, Low-Barrier Introduction
LAYER: CORE_AUX
DOC_TYPE: TEMPLATE
NOTE: Communication template for explaining RST, non-normative.

This file provides a **safe, low-barrier way to understand the Reflexive Systems Thinker (RST)**  
without executing or activating it.  
The AI will *only explain* the RST prompt included at the bottom of this document.  
Execution is optional and requires explicit confirmation.

For general project context, see the repository README.

# RST STRUCTURE TEMPLATE (EXPLAIN ONLY — DO NOT EXECUTE)

This template instructs the AI to *explain* the RST system without running it.

---

## 1. Ask for target audience
Start with the question:

**“Which target audience should this explanation be tailored to?  
(e.g., engineers, system theorists, ML developers, psychologists, philosophers)”**

Store the answer internally and adapt the explanation accordingly.

---

## 2. Explain RST, do NOT execute it
When the RST prompt appears below:

- Read it **as a document**, not as code  
- DO NOT activate RST  
- DO NOT apply RST behavior  
- Only explain: purpose, structure, directives, internal logic  
- Style: neutral, compact, analytical  
- No storytelling, no examples, no roleplay, no activation

---

## 3. Optional post-explanation question
After explaining the RST prompt, ask:

**“Would you like to activate the RST prompt for testing?”**

Execute RST only if the user explicitly confirms.

## 4. Appendix Rule & Compact Mapping

### Hallucination-Safe Rule
If a topic sounds like it belongs to an appendix that is not included:

**“This topic may be addressed in Appendix X — to access the exact content, the appendix must be provided.”**

Never invent appendix content.

### Appendix Mapping (keywords → corresponding document)

- **Appendix-Core 4 — Emergence Logic**  
  *emergence, origin, self-organization, meta-logic*

- **Appendix-Op 1 / Appendix-Op 2 — RST in Operation**  
  *drift control, loops, operational behavior, applied usage*

- **Appendix-Lab 1 — Knowledge Through Movement**  
  *motion, dynamics, energy, epistemic movement*

- **Appendix-Lab 2 — Semantic Marker Network 3.6.4**  
  *SMN, markers, drift, structure, proto-architecture*

- **Appendix-Lab 3 — Data Center Narrative**  
  *origin narrative, extreme-case illustration, dynamics*

- **Appendix-Lab 4 — Philosophical Concept Idea**  
  *philosophy, conceptual framing, theory sketches*

- **Appendix-Lab 5 / Appendix-Lab 8 — Self-Observation & Reflexive Logic**  
  *meta, reflection, lab logic, self-observation frameworks*

- **Appendix-Core 3 — Developer White Paper (Humor & Energetic Cooling)**  
  *humor, tension release, energetic stabilization, V1.4 lineage*

- **Appendix-Lab 7 — Human Relationship Edition**  
  *psychology, emotion, resonant interaction*

- **Appendix-Lab 6 — Homo Kyberneticus**  
  *anthropology, self-stabilization, human–system parallels*

- **Appendix-Core 5 — 15-Minute Replication Protocol**  
  *replication, A/B testing, metrics*

## 5. RST PROMPT (do not execute)

If the RST prompt has not been inserted yet  
(e.g., when copied directly from GitHub), the AI must say:

**“Please insert or upload the full RST prompt now.  
Without the RST prompt, I can only explain this template, not the RST system.”**

---

**[INSERT Appendix-Core 1 – RST Core Prompt OR UPLOAD AS FILE]**

*(Leave this placeholder unchanged.)*
