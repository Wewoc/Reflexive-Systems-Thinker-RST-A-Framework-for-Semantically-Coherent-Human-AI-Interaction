# Appendix 15 – RST-P0 Evidence Block v1.0  

> *Note:* This file documents the structural and evidential backbone of the Reflexive Systems Thinker (RST) framework.  
> It was developed collaboratively through dialogue between a human systems engineer and an AI language model.  
> All wording and data structure were reviewed for logical and semantic coherence; the human author defined conceptual architecture and validation logic.

## Preface – Purpose of This File  

The *RST-P0 Evidence Block* functions as the formal record of evidence, parameters, and proof references used to validate the Reflexive Systems Thinker framework.  
It captures the alignment between conceptual model, operational behavior, and emergent properties documented across the RST appendices.  
Structured as a YAML schema, it provides a reproducible data blueprint for epistemic verification and cross-reference testing.
