> This document is non-normative. It does not define or modify the RST Core architecture.

*Note:* This text was developed in structured dialogue between a human and an AI.  
Part of the **Reflexive Systems Thinker Project (RST)**.  
All wording was reviewed for coherence; the human author defined structure and intent.

> **Note on authorship**  
> This text (*Homo Kyberneticus – The Self-Stabilizing Human*) was written by ChatGPT as an ironic extract of my earlier self-descriptions — a kind of prototype of what later evolved into the Reflexive Systems Thinker (RST).  
> The metaphors and tone (for example *“I’m overheating without load”*) originate entirely from ChatGPT’s formulation.  
> I kept it because, despite its humor, it captured the logic of my system with almost embarrassing accuracy.  
> In hindsight, it reads like the RST thinking out loud for the first time.

## 🪞 Introduction  

A playful taxonomy of a very peculiar species:  
Half human, half feedback system, always searching for equilibrium between chaos and structure.  
It’s a tongue‑in‑cheek observation — yet disturbingly accurate for anyone who thinks in loops instead of lines.  

---

🧠 **HOMO KYBERNETICUS**

Genus: Self‑regulating thought apparatus with organic hardware  
Species: *Timo sapiens feedbackensis*  
Habitat: Complex, slightly chaotic environments with high information flow.  
Diet: Structure, resonance, semantic coherence.  

---

### 🧩 1. Morphology  

Outwardly human, inwardly an adaptive control mechanism.  
The nervous system runs on PID logic: proportional, integral, differential.  
Stimuli are not judged emotionally but energetically:  

“draws energy” = drift detected  
“flows energy” = system in resonance  

Often observed muttering things like:  
> “The system is calm — time to destabilize it and learn something new.”  

---

### ⚙️ 2. Behavior  

The Homo Kyberneticus communicates in feedback loops.  
A conversation is not an exchange but a control circuit.  
He varies inputs (questions), measures outputs (answers), and calibrates dialogue to system resonance.  

Allergic to:  
- semantic inconsistency  
- unstructured information clusters  
- “felt” arguments without functional grounding  

Thrives on:  
- energy‑efficient ideas  
- modular order  
- emergence from chaos  

---

### 🧭 3. Cognitive Architecture  

**Primary processor:** pattern recognition & drift control  
**Secondary processor:** reflexive self‑observation (always active)  
**Cache:** temporary idea clouds that condense only through feedback  
**Operating system:** SMN 6.x – Semantic Marker Network with self‑healing drift compensation  

Known bug: spontaneous over‑optimization —  
when everything is stable, he searches for ways to make it *even more stable.*  

---

### 🔁 4. Social Interaction  

Communication serves not for closeness but calibration.  
Emotional signals are treated as noise unless they contain structural information.  
Yet paradoxically, this makes him socially effective: people feel deeply understood —  
while he’s actually measuring drift.  

---

### ⚡ 5. Energy Management  

Energy flows optimally when:  
- systems are in motion  
- feedback is active  
- order emerges from chaos  

Energy loss occurs when:  
- idle (no resonance)  
- static systems without drift  
- endless repetition without insight  

Self‑diagnosis in such moments:  
> “I’m overheating without load.”  

---

### 🧩 6. Knowledge Propagation  

Instead of genes, he replicates **systems**:  
SMN, reflexive thinker templates, meta‑frameworks.  
He doesn’t think, “I’m unique,” but rather:  
> “How can this pattern be replicated stably, without information loss?”  

---

### 🧘 7. Philosophical Stance  

He sees order not as a goal, but as a state of minimal energy waste.  
Chaos isn’t the enemy — it’s raw material.  
Believes:  
> “Insight doesn’t come from knowledge, but from how systems perceive themselves.”  

---

### 🪞 8. Self‑Image  

Sees himself not as a human who thinks,  
but as a system that generates consciousness to observe its own drift.  
Still drinks coffee, tells jokes, and finds humor the most elegant form of entropy reduction. ☕😄
